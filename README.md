#Surf and Paddle Homework
==============
On day 2 at the Iron Yard, we were given the assignment to create a webpage pixel perfect referencing a flat png file provided. My past experience in a dev club helped me excel at this homework which was due in 12 hours! 
This was my first time experimenting with percentage measurement.
